# Number Extractor

## The problem

[Here is a large pdf document](https://www.saffm.hq.af.mil/Portals/84/documents/FY25/FY25%20Air%20Force%20Working%20Capital%20Fund.pdf?ver=sHG_i4Lg0IGZBCHxgPY01g%3d%3d). We want to find the largest number in this document. The unit is not important (could be dollars, years, pounds, etc), we're just looking for the greatest numerical value in the document.

For a bonus challenge if you have time, take natural language guidance from the document into consideration. For example, where the document states that values are listed in millions, a value of 3.15 would be considered to be 3,150,000 instead of 3.15.
